          Para PH uses a progressive data collection model: we keep data minimal at first and expand only as needed to deliver value to partners and users. Depending on your relationship with us, we may collect:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pl-5 text-gray-600 marker:text-purple-600">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Mobility and GPS data.</span> Real-time and historical location, route paths based on movement, trip timestamps (start, stop, duration), and movement behavior such as speed and idle periods through your device and GPS modules integrated in PUVs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Fleet operations data.</span> Dispatch frequency, vehicle intervals, stop dwell times, route adherence, and vehicle activity states (active, idle, offline).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold text-gray-800">IoT and technical data.</span> Non-personal device identifiers assigned to GPS units, connectivity strength, uptime, signal quality, and hardware diagnostics including battery performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Media and participation data.</span> Photos, videos, or recordings related to device installation, pilot activities, field operations, and public communications, collected only with explicit consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Network intelligence (aggregated).</span> Demand signals (e.g. estimated passenger levels), peak movement patterns, boarding and alighting estimates, route structures, stop locations, and events such as congestion or road closures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold text-gray-800">System performance and feedback.</span> Accuracy of estimated travel times, route consistency metrics, and voluntary observations from drivers about route conditions.
